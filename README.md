# CMC New Coin Web Scraping
Simple webscraping project with python turned into smal tracking database with CSV and PostegreSQL

I tried experimenting with some small webscraping with python and also cleaning some data to then
put into a CSV to import it into a table in PostgreSQL. It was my first time working with data scraping
and PostgreSQL.
